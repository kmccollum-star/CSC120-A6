What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
I think Unit Testing will be helpful for my programming in the future. It is very effective in finding bugs and helps me to better understand how a program is supposed to operate.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked for me was testing the methods first to see if they can complete their basic purposes and then focusing on the smaller details within each method like whether or not the methods actually throw an exception. I think this was the best way for me to get a feel for what the source code was supposed to do and where bugs were likely to be. 

What didn't work for me was trying to find all the bugs within one method at the same time. I ended up looking at the same method for a long time and eventually, I was burnt out. It was better for me to just find one bug at a time per method and then look through the methods again.

Some advice I would give someone is to just try testing random things, ESPECIALLY the things that you think are guaranteed to work. For instance, I was really hesitant to test the Computer constructor because I assumed that there was no way there could be a bug in the constructor, however, there was one. Testing everything leads to paths that one might not have been aware of.
